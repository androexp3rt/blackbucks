    (100% - 60px) / 2) = ?????

in CSS the syntax to this expression will be :

    calc(calc(100% - 60px)/2);

which means :

let's suppose we are talking about a property such as width, then for the current element in which we are writing this CSS, its width will be equal to px value of(100% of parent width) minus 60 px and its output divide by 2, then the result will be converted back to `%` and that will be the %value of width of Current element.

and the other way :

    (100% parent width) = X px;
    X px - 60 px = Y px;
    (Y px converted to %) = Z %;
    z % / 2 = result in %;
